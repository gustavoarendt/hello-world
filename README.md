# hello-world

testing first github repo

Hi, I'm Gustavo, a Mechanical Engineering Student, focusing on start a career in Web Devolopment.

Fell in love with programming about less than one year ago, when I figured out how amazing was to create things from scratch with code,
until now I almost tested many different areas of technology, the one I got most in-depth was python, which I used for data science,
using mostly pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, them explored machine learning, mostly using scikit-learn, and recently I had tried backend with Django.
